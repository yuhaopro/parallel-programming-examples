# Description
This is a compilation of parallel programming examples and my coursework assignment at the University of Edinburgh. 
<br />

I have made annotations along the way to understand how to utilize the pthreads library to create multi-threaded applications in C. 
The code includes using simple locking mechanisms such as mutexes and semaphores for mutual exclusion, and more complex mechanisms such as barriers and monitors for thread synchronization
# Running the code
```
gcc <filename>.c -o test
./test 
```
